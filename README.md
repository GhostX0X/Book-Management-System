# Book-Management-System
This is a simple book management application that allows you to add, delete, and search for books in an XML file. The application is written in Python and uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The code is written in Python 3 and may not be compatible with Python 2.

# Getting Started
Download the code files and save them in a directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are saved.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install tkinter
This will install the Tkinter library if it's not already installed.

Run the application by executing the following command:
python book_management.py
This will launch the book management application.

# Usage
The book management application provides the following features:

- Add Book: Allows you to add a new book to the XML file. Enter the book's title, author, genre, and publication year in the respective entry fields and click the "Add Book" button.

- Delete Book: Allows you to delete a book from the XML file. Enter the title of the book you want to delete in the "Title" entry field and click the "Delete Book" button.

- Search Books: Allows you to search for books based on a selected attribute and a search value. Select an attribute from the drop-down menu, enter the search value in the entry field, and click the "Search Books" button. The matching books will be displayed in the text area below.

Clear Entries: Clicking the "Clear Entries" button will clear all the entry fields.

Note: The XML file, "books.xml", should be present in the same directory as the code file. The XML file should have the following structure:
